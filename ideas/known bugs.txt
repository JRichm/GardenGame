[FIXED] 
• loading /leaderboards with no map data
 - if you open a leaderboard page with empty levels, jinja freaks out because there is no map data.
 - the error is caused from jinja trying to .split(',') the map data, but there is nothing to split!


[FIXED] 
• game selection does not match highlighted UI element
 - the system that keeps track of the users selection in game and the system that highlights the user selection
   are separate and need to be merged to create a smoother experience for the player
 - sometimes one plant will be highlighted but a different plant will be planted once the user clicks the game
   board


• user can create an account without putting in password
 - no user input validation


• user can go to empty leaderboards pages
 - dont redirect  user if there are not leaderboard stats on the next page
 - also fix the rendering of the last page if there are < 3 saves
