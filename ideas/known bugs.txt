[FIXED] 
• loading /leaderboards with no map data
 - if you open a leaderboard page with empty levels, jinja freaks out because there is no map data.
 - the error is caused from jinja trying to .split(',') the map data, but there is nothing to split!


• game selection does not match highlighted UI element
 - the way the game keeps track of the users selection and the way the ui is set up to display the users selection
   are two different systems. these need to be merged for a more smooth playing expirence
 - sometimes one fruit will be highlighted but a different plant will be planted once the user clicks the game
   board


• user can create an account without putting in password
 - no user input validation
